             <dl>
                 <dd>Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.</dd>

                 <dl>
                     <dd>Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</dd>

                     <dt><h3>Git/GitHub terms:</h3></dt>
                     <dd><span class="term-title">repository: </span>A directory or storage space where your projects can live. Sometimes GitHub users shorten this to “repo.” It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it, inside a repository.</dd>
                     <br>
                     <dd><span class="term-title">commit: </span>This is the command that gives Git its power. When you commit, you are taking a “snapshot” of your repository at that point in time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore your project to any previous state.</dd>
                     <br>
                     <dd><span class="term-title">fork: </span>Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository, also known as the "upstream" repository. After you fork a repository, you can fetch updates from the upstream repository to keep your fork up to date, and you can propose changes from your fork to the upstream repository with pull requests. A fork can be owned by either a personal account or an organization.</dd>
                     <br>
                     <dd><span class="term-title">push: </span>The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.</dd>
                     <br>
                     <dd><span class="term-title">pull requests: </span>Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.</dd>
                     <br>
                     <dd><span class="term-title">workflows: </span>Workflows are defined in the .github/workflows directory in a repository, and a repository can have multiple workflows, each of which can perform a different set of tasks. For example, you can have one workflow to build and test pull requests, another workflow to deploy your application every time a release is created, and still another workflow that adds a label every time someone opens a new issue.</dd>
                     <br>
                     <dd><span class="term-title">issues: </span>Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work. To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request.</dd>
                     <br>
                     <dd><span class="term-title">raw button: </span>With the raw view, you can view or copy the raw content of a file without any styling. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. Click the file that you want to view. In the upper-right corner of the file view, click Raw.</dd>
                     <br>
                     <dd><span class="term-title">blame button: </span>You can view raw file content or trace changes to lines in a file and discover how parts of the file evolved over time./dd>
