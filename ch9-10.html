            <h2>Stack Overfolow Q & A:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li class="answer">Q.What is the purpose of Stack Overflow?</li>
                <dl class="this">Stack Overflow helps people find the answers they need, when they need them. We're best known for our public Q&A platform that over 100 million people visit every month to ask questions, learn, and share technical knowledge.</dl>

                <li class="answer">How much research effort is expected of Stack Overflow users?</li>
                <dl class="this">A lot. Asking a question on Stack Overflow should be the last step in your process for finding an answer—if the information that you need already exists, then you should be able to find it before asking.</dl>

                <li class="answer">Why should I post complete errors? Why isn't the message itself enough?</li>
                <dl class="this">A generic message like "No such file or directory" only says something about the specific error code that was returned, but nothing about where, why or how it happened.The rest of the error message is vital for filling in the gaps. It's especially important to copy-paste everything exactly as it is, because even tiny changes in punctuation provide important information.</dl>
                
                <li class="answer">Why should I not upload images of code/data/errors?</li>
                <dl class="this">The first reason is that links to images fail. The second reason is that text on images is not searchable. The third reason is that it gives you an incentive 'not to try'; simply show us a screenshot of your code and call it a day.</dl>

                <li class="answer">Why is "Can someone help me?" not an actual question?</li>
                <dl class="this">Stack Overflow is a question & answer site. You may think that you have asked a reasonable, answerable question, but a question like "Can someone help me"? really doesn't qualify. First, a bit of background: The purpose of Stack Overflow is to create a knowledge repository of solutions to programming problems. Its mantra is "Make the Internet a better place". That means that a primary characteristic of a good question is that it is likely to be searched by someone else. "Will you help me do X?" doesn't do that. More than likely, no one will ever be trying to do, and searching for, the exact same thing as you in exactly the same way.</dl>

                <li class="answer">Under what circumstances may I add "urgent" or other similar phrases to my question, in order to obtain faster answers?</li>
                <dl class="this">At best this is extra fluff in your question, which gets in the way of your actual question. This makes it harder for people to help you, which makes it less likely that you'll get an answer. Nobody is going to see that you need an answer ASAP and then drop everything they're doing in order to help you. Your emergencies are your own. Alternatively: lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part. At worst it'll be seen as very rude.</dl>

                <li class="answer">Advice for non-native English speakers</li>
                <dl class="this">If you aren't a native English speaker, here are some rules that can improve some of the reactions to your posts, and also the quality of the answers to your questions.(If you are a native English speaker, you should also be following these rules.)Behind the questions and answers on this site, there is a complex reviewing/moderating mechanism, and your extra efforts can make some of that work significantly easier for the rest of us.</dl>
