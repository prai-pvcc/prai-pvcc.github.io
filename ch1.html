        <h2>Three misconceptions about Computer Science:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You have to be good at math to succeed in computer science.</li>
            <li>computer science is all about coding</li>
            <li>Learning computer science is more difficult than learning subjects in business and managment.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Briefly define:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Computer Science</b></li>
            <p>Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. </p>
            
            <li><b>Algorithm</b></li>
            <p>A algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem step-by-step to accomplish a task</p>
            
            <li><b>Sequential Operation</b></li>
            <p>Sequential Operation is a sequence of instructions that caries out a single well defined task then when that task is finished it moves on to the next one. </p>
            
            <li><b>Conditional Operation</b></li>
            <p>Conditional Operation is "question-asking set of instructions because they ask questions and it moves foward baised on the input.</p>
            <li><b>Iterative Operation</b></li>
            <p>Iterative Operation unlike the other operation repeats a set of instructions until it gets the value that has been set.</p>
            
            <li><b>Store Program Computer</b></li>
            <p>A computer that stores instructions in its memory to enable it to preform a varity of tasks in a sequence or intermittently. </p> 
            <li><b>Programmer</b></li>
            <p>A person who writes, modfies, and tests code that allows computer software and applications to function properly.</p>
            <li><b>Integrated Circuit</b></li>
            <p>A chip with thouands or millions of tiny resistors, capacitros, diodes, and transistors that is able to function as many things like a timer, counter, logic gate, or even computer memory. </p>
        </ol>

        <h2>Briefly describe these computer generations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>First generation computer</strong></li>
            <p>The first generation computers came about in 1940-1956. The computers would take up entire rooms as it was a huge computer, would be expensive to operate, and cost a lot of electriy to run.</p> 
            <li><strong>Second generation computer</strong></li>
            <p>The Second generation computers was roughly from 1956 to 1963. The first generation used vacuum tubes but it is replaced by transistors in the 2nd generation of computers. the transistiors were invented at Bell labs in 1947 but it was not widespreead in computers until the late 1950s. With the use of transistors the computors were made to be more compact, faster, cheeper, more energry-effcient, and more reliable than first gen. computers.</p>
            <li><strong>Third generation computer</strong></li>
            <p>With 3rd generation computers, intergrated circuits came about, and the transistotrs were made smaller and placed on sillicon chips. The sillicon chips were called semiconductors which made the spped and efficiency of computers better.</p>
            <li><strong>Fourth generation computer</strong></li>
            <p>In 4th generation computers people were advancing more and more, and with it brought microporcessors which made it so that a computer doesn't have to take entire rooms, but can be in the palm of your hand. people started to sell computers for the home with the technology of microprocessor with IBM releasing one in 1981, and Apple creating Macintosh in 1984.</p>
            <li><strong>Fifth generation computer</strong></li>
            <p>the 5th generation is the lastest of computers that is used as of now(2023).The 5th generation is based upon AI(Artificial intelligence), and it is still not fully developed. With 5th generation of computers people are trying to make it so it is able to self learn and be able to learn.</p>   

        </ol>
        <h3>FORTRAN</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What does the acronym FORTRAN stand for?</li>
            <p>The acronym FORTRAN stands for Formula Translation. </p>
            <li>When was FORTRAN developed?</li>
            <p>FORTRAN was developed in 1957.</p>
            <li>Is FORTRAN still being used today? if so, what for?</li>
            <p>FORTRAN is stll being used today in Doppler radar weather forecasts, atmospheric, and oceanic studies.</p>
        </ol>
        <h3>COBAL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What does the acronym COBOL stand for?</li>
            <p>COBAL stands for common BUsiness Oriented language</p>
            <li>When was COBAL developed?</li>
            <p>COBAl first appeared in 1950s</p>
            <li>is COBAL still being used today? if so, what for?</li>
            <P>COBAL is still being used today in the financial sector as COBAl was designed to process data such as transaction processing systems. It has also been used for finanical transaction, ticket reservations, hotal booking, and any form of transaction.</P>
