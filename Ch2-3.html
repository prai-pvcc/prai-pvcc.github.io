        <h2>Chapter 2: algorithms</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Explain why natural languge is not an effecive tool for describing algorithms.</li><br>
            <dt>requires clarification dialogue.
                may require more keystrokes.
                may not show context.
                is unpredictable.</dt>
            <li>Problem 1:</li>
            <dt>A studnet has three grades; the final grade is the average of the three. List the algorithmic steps to find the final grade.</dt><br>
            <li>Problem 2:</li>
            <dt>A car owner recorded the car's previous car milege, current mileage, and the number of gallons of gas the owner filled thier tank with. List the algorithmic steps to find the car's mpg(miles per gallon.)</dt>

        <h2>Chapter 2: briefly describe or define:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Natural languge</li>
            <dt>the language we speak and write in  our everyday lives. (This could be English, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, or Swahili. 
                /dt><br>
            <li>pseudocode</li>
            <dt> represents a compromise  
                between the two extremes of natural and formal languages. It is simple,  
                highly readable, and has virtually no grammatical rules. (In fact, pseudo 
                code is sometimes jokingly referred to as “a programming language with 
                out the details.”)
            </dt>
        </ol>

        <h2>Chapter 3: Briefly describe or define:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Why algorithms should be correct</li>
            <dt>An important aspect of any algorithm is that it is correct: it always produces the expected output for the range of inputs and it eventually terminates.</dt><br>

            <li>Why algoritms should be efficent</li>
            <dt>As programmers we code with the future in mind and to do that, efficiency is key. Creating efficient algorithms is about reducing the amount of iterations needed to complete your task in relation to the size of the dataset.</dt><br>

            <li>program maintenace</li>
            <dt>the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more.  </dt><br>

            <li>Importance of algoritm: ease of understanding</li>
            <dt>The algorithm makes us to break anything into small steps, for easy and effective understanding of the complex things.</dt><br>
            
            <li>algorithmic elegance </li>
            <dt>Elegance often implies simplicity and consistency of design, focusing on the main or basic features of an object; decoration and features are often minimalistic.</dt><br>

            <li>sequential search algorithm </li>
            <dt> is the simplest type of search, it is used when a list of integers is not in any order. It examines the first element in the list and then examines each "sequential" element in the list until a match is found. This match could be a desired work that you are searching for, or the minimum number in the list.</dt><br>

            <li>order of magnitude</li>
            <dt>Order of magnitude is the quantity of powers of 10 that there are in a number, or the number of powers of 0.1 in a negative number.</dt><br>

            <li>selection sort</li>
            <dt>Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.</dt><br>

            <li>Flop(floating point operation)</li>
            <dt>Floating-point is, according to IBM, "a method of encoding real numbers within the limits of finite precision available on computers."</dt><br>

            <li>Teraflop</li>
            <dt>a unit of measure for the calculating speed of a computer equal to one trillion floating-point operations per second</dt><br>
            
            <li>Petaflop</li>
            <dt>A petaflop is one thousand trillion, or one quadrillion, operations per second, and represents an extremely fast computing speed for a single machine.</dt><br>

            <li>parallel Processor</li>
            <dt>Parallel processing is a computing technique when multiple streams of calculations or data processing tasks co-occur through numerous central processing units (CPUs) working concurrently. This article explains how parallel processing works and examples of its application in real-world use cases. </dt><br>

            <li>Data cleanup problem</li>
            <dt> Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.</dt><br>

            <li>binary seatch algoritm</li>
            <dt>used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log n). </dt><br>

            <li>pattern matching</li>
            <dt>is a technique where you test an expression to determine if it has certain characteristics. C# pattern matching provides more concise syntax for testing expressions and taking action when an expression matches</dt><br>
